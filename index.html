    <h1>Finding the rap game Kevin Bacon</h1>
    <h2>Using <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/aysylu/loom">Loom</a> to create the Rap
    Graph</h2>
    <p>We've all heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon Number</a>, some of us
    have heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erd≈ës number</a>, and an even
    smaller subset of us have heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphy_Number">Morphy
    number</a>. This author would like to humbly add to this canon,
    and he therefore introduces the Lil Wayne Number.</p>

    <p>The author has scraped the excellent <a href="http://rapgenius.com/">Rap
    Genius</a> (Note: no money was exchanged for this link) and created
    a graph where the nodes are rappers and the edges are collaborations. </p>

    <p>Use the form below to find a path between two rappers</p>
    
    <h3>Technical details</h3>
    <p>The work was split into two parts - the scraping, and the
    graph work. For the scraping, the fledling core.async library was
    used. This allowed thousands of pages to be scraped concurrently</p>
